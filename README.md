## 📌 About

The **Zerodha Landing Page** is a front-end clone of Zerodha’s official homepage, built using **HTML and CSS**.  
This project was created to practice **UI replication, layout design, and responsive styling** by recreating a real-world fintech website.

The goal of this project is not to copy functionality, but to understand how professional landing pages are structured — including spacing, typography, alignment, and visual hierarchy — and how they can be implemented from scratch using clean, semantic code.

This project also serves as a **portfolio piece**, demonstrating attention to detail, design accuracy, and modern web development practices.
